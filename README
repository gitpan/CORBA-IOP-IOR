NAME
     CORBA::IOP::IOR -  Decode, munge, and re-encode CORBA IORs.

SYNOPSIS

     #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

     require CORBA::IOP::IOR;

     $ior = new CORBA::IOP::IOR;
     $ior->parseIOR($ARGV[0]);

     $ior->printHash();

     $ior->{IIOP_profile}->{host} = "host.domain.name";

     print $ior->stringifyIOR(), "\n";


INSTALLATION
     The installation uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Uncompress and extract
     the files from the tar, then:

   	perl Makefile.PL
	make
   	make install

DESCRIPTION
     CORBA::IOP::IOR is a handy module for processing IORs. I've found
     it very useful for debugging CORBA interoperability.

     It was written without much of a look at other Perl CORBA efforts
     (COPE etc.), and is small and understandable.

TO DO
     Some documentation might be nice.

     I think whats here is correct, but it needs to be checked against
     the OMG spec.'s a bit more rigorously.

     Decode TAG_MULTIPLE_COMPONENTS.
